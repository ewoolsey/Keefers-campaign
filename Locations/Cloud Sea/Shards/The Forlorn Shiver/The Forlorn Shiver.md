[[Myrrdin Chosaach]], born upon one of the oldest and most ancient [[Shards]] referred to by its denizens as [[The Forlorn Shiver]]. Many [[Shards]] in this world tend to frequently drift by each other in close proximity, but the shiver seems to drift the endless skies with a mind of its own, always managing to avoid nearby interactions, always managing to stay hidden to all but the [[Human Kingdom|most observant]]. The shiver is a long needle-like land mass with its tip nearly 5 miles wide, and its length some many hundreds of miles across. Atop its peak is a lush sanctuary filled with trees that tower 1000s of feet high and a plethora of [[strange oversized animals]], many of which are friendly, though some definitely are not. At the centre of this sanctuary is crystal clear lake, [[Lynn Ail-Lenwi]], which plunges to depths never before explored, some say these depths are a portal to a far off world entirely submerged in water. Shiver is home to the [[Brethyn Noswaith]].

# Appearance
Appearance: Myrrdin Chosach is a 19yr old humanoid male with sky blue skin. Soft patches of white undulate around his exterior almost giving the illusion of clouds rolling across his person. Standing closer you can see Myrrdin's complexion is almost translucent at times.  
# Backstory
From a young age Myrrdin Chosaach knew that he was meant to lead his people. He felt a strong link between himself and the cosmos, noticing strong connections and divinations between the stars and the material plane. In an effort to prove himself worthy of becoming a [[Primevil Speakers]] he decided to undertake a challenge known as an [[A'lawdrinaieth]].

Myrrdin has a [[mother]], [[father]] and [[sister]] that he cares for very much, and whom care for him in return. He spends as much time with them as a son would, but his relationship with his uncle [[Nikephoros]] is particularly strong. Nikephoros is one of the 13 [[Ymarferydd]] on Shiver, capable of speaking directly with the [[Eidolons of The Forlorn Shiver|eidolons]]. He is a prime candidate to become one of the [[Primevil Speakers]] of [[Brethyn Noswaith]]. When a Primeval Speaker passes on to the next realm, a challenge is initiated (Feel free to go crazy with this if it ever comes up) that any established member of the Noswaith (who has completed their [[A'lawdrinaieth]]) can enter. Currently 2 of the 5 elders are becoming particularly old and frail, and the Noswaith people are concerned that [[Nikephoros]] may be too liberal to take their place

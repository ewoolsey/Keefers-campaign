The tip of [[The Forlorn Shiver]], is home to an old civilization of men and women who call themselves [[Brethyn Noswaith|Brethyn Noswaith]]. The leaders of these people are a group of 5 elders who together form the [[Primevil Speakers]]. Ascending into this position of leadership is highly respected by many [[Brethyn Noswaith|Noswaith]] people (of which there are approximately 1200).

The core of what constitutes [[Brethyn Noswaith|The Noswaith]] people is their close connection with the stars and the night sky. Over generations they have created some of the finest lenses and optics ever crafted in this world in an effort to gain a greater understanding of what lies in the realms beyond. Stationed atop the highest point of [[Mount Chiron]] (The tallest mountain on Shiver) is the [[Noswaith Observatory]]. This location is both a revered sanctuary for the Noswaith people, and also the nexus for the scientific research that the Noswaith take part in. [[Myrrdin Chosaach|Myrrdin's]] close relationship with [[Nikephoros]] led him to spending much of his adolescent life here. The dome-like observatory is so imposingly large and sits upon such a prominent spot on the island that many know it as the [[Noswaith Observatory|The Great Eye of the Forlorn Shiver]]. The magics that run and power the observatory are drawn through connections to the deep routes that run to the core of the island. Some even tell stories that the observatory itself functions as the eye of Shiver in a more literal sense, giving Shiver an awareness of it’s surroundings and adjusting it’s location in the cloud sea accordingly.

The Noswaith don’t want to be found. Many of them are scared of what lies beyond their home. Using their observatory they've witnessed other sky ships or shards floating at great distances, and made the conscious decision not to reach out. As far as [[Myrrdin Chosaach]] and the rest of the noswaith are concerned, They haven't been discovered by any outsiders.

The source of the Noswaith's knowledge is multifaceted. Some knowledge has been recovered through various tribe members [[A'lawdrinaieth|A’lawdrinaieths]]. Some knowledge is likely a little hazy since many stories have been passed down over dozens of generations. There are a select few Noswaith, known as the [[Ymarferydd]], who are able to directly commune with the [[Eidolons of The Forlorn Shiver|eidolons]]. Some people say the more powerful eidolons seek out men and woman all across the cloud sea in an effort to form a connection with humanity, and with the world at large. These communions are usually very private. There are a dozen or so Noswaith that have claimed to commune directly with the spirits, Myrrdin has longed to seek them out but as of yet has been unsuccessful. During these communions, both knowledge, power, and kinship are shared between both parties. Though most [[Ymarferydd]] are scarce about the details they share about these meetings to others.

[[Myrrdin Chosaach|Myrrdin]] grew up listening to tales told by his [[Primevil Speakers|elders]] during tribal gatherings. Some of the most notable chronicles he recalls hearing from his uncle [[Nikephoros]] include:

[[Myrrdin Chosaach|Myrrdin's]]  uncle [[Nikephoros]] completed his own [[A'lawdrinaieth]] nearly 12 years ago by scaling the sheer cliffs that line the edge of the [[The Forlorn Shiver]] until he reached the very bottom, scraping against sky itself. There, [[Nikephoros]] discovered the ruins of some ancient arcane technology. A dark energy lingered around the base of the Shiver and these ruins. [[Nikephoros]], got too close to this structure, and when his hand made contact with it, a dark energy pulsed, radiated and perfused through [[Nikephoros]] himself, and the entire island at large, seemingly activated by his presence. Since that day 12 years ago, a corrupting energy has slowly been creeping it's way up to the top of the shiver, almost as if the sheer cliffs on it's edge were rusting and turning a sickly reddish colour. Large boulders from its edge calving and falling into the depths of the [[Cloud Sea]].

Since these events, The [[Primevil Speakers|elders]] of the [[Brethyn Noswaith]] have sent other scouts to the bottom of the shiver, and they deduced that the source of this corruption was from the fracturing of an ancient and powerful artifact, A weapon given the name the [[Spire of the Solar Wind]]. No one is sure what's has caused this artifact to fracture in two, only that the other half is out there somewhere, perhaps attached to the base of another shard, perhaps stuck at the bottomless depths of the [[Cloud Sea]].

When [[Myrrdin Chosaach|Myrrdin]] left the [[The Forlorn Shiver|Shiver]] to complete his [[A'lawdrinaieth]] he was tasked by the [[Primevil Speakers]] to seek out a woman who's name was written in the stars directly at the zenith of the [[The Forlorn Shiver]]. A Women by the name of [[Sidereum]]. The Elders divinations could not reveal much more about this mysterious person, only that she would play an important role in the solution to this dire problem, and that perhaps [[Myrrdin Chosaach|Myrrdin]], guided by the stars themselves,  would be fortunate enough to cross her path.
